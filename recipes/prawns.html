        <p><h4>Description</h4></p>
        <p>Simple to put together with only 4 ingredients, but big on flavor! I like to use "extra jumbo" size shrimp, which are 16-20 per pound. Cutting the bacon lengthwise into narrow strips makes it easier to wrap. Refrigerating the shrimp, as well as using thin-cut bacon, will prevent the shrimp from overcooking in the time it takes to crisp the bacon.</p>
        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shrimp</li>
            <li>Cajun Seasoning</li>
            <li>Thinly sliced bacon</li>
            <li>Toothpicks</li>
            <li>2 tbsp hot honey.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h4>Directions</h4></p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Place shrimp on a plate and sprinkle both sides with Cajun seasoning. Wrap each shrimp with 1 narrow strip of bacon and fasten with a toothpick. Refrigerate for 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Air-fry shrimp for 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until bacon is lightly crispy, 4 to 5 minutes more. You may have to do 2 batches depending on the size of your air fryer.</li>
            <li>Remove shrimp to a plate and drizzle with hot honey. Serve immediately, being watchful of any toothpicks.</li>
        </ol>
