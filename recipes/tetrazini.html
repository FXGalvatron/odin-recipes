        <p>Delicious and creamy! This recipe is my brother's favorite of everything that I cook, and the first one I mastered.</p>
        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 Pound Fettucine Pasta</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Onions, Mushroom, Red Bell Pepper</li>
            <li>Chicken Broth</li>
            <li>2 skinless and boneless chicken breats</li>
            <li>Garlic chopped</li>
            <li>Whipping Cream and Milk</li>
            <li>Cheeses</li>
            <li>Thyme</li>
            <li>Salt and Black Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h4>Directions</h4></p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken strips in the hot oil until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Remove chicken to a bowl, leaving pan drippings in skillet. Melt margarine in the hot skillet; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and garlic in skillet until mushrooms have softened and given up their liquid, about 5 minutes. Stir red bell pepper into mixture and sprinkle with flour. Stir to coat and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Slowly mix chicken broth into vegetables, stirring to form a thick sauce; mix cream and milk into sauce. Simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Mix 1/2 cup Swiss cheese, 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, thyme, salt, and black pepper into sauce and simmer until cheese have melted and combined with sauce.</li>
            <li>Spread half the cooked fettuccine pasta into bottom of prepared casserole dish, top with half the chicken and half the cream sauce. Repeat layers once more and sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons Swiss cheese, 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese, and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese topping is nicely browned, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
